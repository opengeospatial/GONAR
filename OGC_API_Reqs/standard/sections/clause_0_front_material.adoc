{set:bgcolor:#D5F5E3}

The OGC API standards family includes a set of resources that enable anyone to provide or use geospatial information. These APIs primarily describe the publication and access to data (e.g. features, coverages), although they may also reference metadata (i.e. records).

This Standard takes a step further by defining the OGC API - Requirements, which builds upon the concept of OGC API - Records. OGC API - Records is designed to catalogue metadata records. Commonly the records managed by the OGC API records contain metadata associated with resources created by the producer and are formulated from the producer's point of view. In contrast, OGC API - Requirements specifies how to use the same OGC API Records to provide the users perspective allowing them to describe datasets (existing or hypothetical) that users needs to collect, store, analyze, and present to achieve their objectives. Commonly these descriptions are known as data requirements. Data requirements describe resource that users hope to find either as a geospatial collection or as a metadata record in a OGC API Records (in many cases the resource described may no exist yet).

//Accordingly, this OGC API - Feedback uses the following components defined in the OGC Geospatial User Feedback standard:
//* a feedback item
//* a feedback collection (that acts as a feedback catalog)
//* a feedback statistic

Accordingly, this OGC API - Requirements manages the following resources:
* points of contact (items and collections)
* needs (items and collections)
* data requirements (items and collections)
* projects (items and collections)

//Thus, a _feedback item_ is the atomic unit of information within a collection, just as a record is in OGC API - Records.  
Thus, the _point of contact item_, the _need item_, the _data requirement item_ and the _project item_ are the atomic units of information within the respective collections. Thus, each group of items corresponds to a collection that corresponds to a catalog, just as a catalog is in OGC API - Records.

This standard defines
* a common set of query parameters
* the characteristics for implementing a data requirements Web API following the OGC API - Requirements.

The OGC API - Requirements allows not only the HTTP GET method for queries, but also adopts from OGC API - Features - Part 4 the capabilities for creating, modifying and deleting collections using HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.

The following tables lists the endpoints of the OGC API - Requirements that allow any collection to be searched or to be interacted with:

In a simple case where the Web API has only one instance of the mentioned collections, the Point of contact collection will have `PoC` as collectionId, the Need collection will have `Need` as collectionId, Data requirement collection will have `Requirement` as a collectionId and Project collection will have `Project` as a collectionId.

[big]*iv.   Security considerations*

See OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, Clause 11.

See OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete, Clause 11.

In addition to the exposed in OGC API - Features - Part 1 and OGC API - Features - Part 4, a common OGC API - Requirements expects the contributions of many different uses, making the management of the privileges different from a common OGC API - Features.

//These are the common rules for the management of feedback:
These are the common rules for the management of users:
* Every user has privileges to create new record.

Users making modifications to resources need to:
//* Every user that was able to authenticate, has privileges to create new feedback.
* Every user that was able to authenticate, has privileges to create new points of contact, needs, and data requirements, as well as to modify or delete only the records that they have created.
//* Some special users, acting as a moderators, will have privileges to modify or delete only the records that any other user generated.
* Special users, acting as administrators or reviewers, will have privileges to modify or delete points of contact, needs, and data requirements that any other user generated as well as to create, modify or delete projects.

The API definition must reflect this in the resource paths and their available methods.

The service provider should make every reasonable effort to ensure that  points of contact, needs, data requirements and projects records are trustworthy and do not contain false, harmful, illegal or irrelevant information. Active administrators and reviewers (human or AI) should review the records and remove any that have been proven to be unacceptable or are incomplete. Users who repeatedly include unacceptable information should have their privileges revoked, their authentication rights deactivated, and, eventually, all their contributions that cannot be proven correct removed.
