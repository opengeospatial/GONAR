The OGC API standards family includes a set of resources that enable anyone to provide or use geospatial information. These APIs primarily describe the publication and access to data (e.g. features), although they may also reference metadata (i.e. records).

This Standard takes a step further by defining the OGC API - Feedback, which builds upon the concept of OGC API - Records. OGC API - Records is designed to catalogue records. Commonly these records managed by the OGC API records contain metadata associated with resources created by the producer and from the producer's point of view. In contrast, OGC API - Feedback specifies how use the same OGC API Records to provide the users perspective allowing them to comment, rate, describe their usage, report errors or deficiencies they have found, link the data or metadata to related documentation, or report on bits of knowledge they have produced and want to share, etc. following the GUF standard. User feedback can be provided on any resource in the same OGC API instance or in other OGC API implementations, whether a geospatial collection or a metadata record in a OGC API Records collection. Moreover, it enables the reporting of statistics on these feedbacks, which can inform other users.

Accordingly, this OGC API - Feedback uses the following components defined in the OGC Geospatial User Feedback standard:
* a feedback item
* a feedback collection (that acts as a feedback catalog)
* a feedback statistic

Thus, a _feedback item_ is the atomic unit of information within a collection, just as a record is in OGC API - Records.  

This standard defines
* a common set of query parameters
* the requirements and characteristics for implementing a user feedback API following OGC API - Feedback.

Since the very nature of feedback is based on user contributions, OGC API - Feedback allows not only the HTTP GET method for queries, but also adopts from OGC API - Features - Part 4 the capabilities for creating, modifying and deleting feedback items using HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.

The following tables lists the endpoints of the OGC API - Feedback that allow a collection of feedbacks to be searched or to be interacted with:

//== Security considerations

See OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, Clause 11.

See OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete, Clause 11.

In addition the exposed in OGC API - Features - Part 1 and See OGC API - Features - Part 4, a common OGC API - Feedbacks expects the contributions of many different uses, making the management of the privileges different from a common OGC API - Features. These are the common rules for the management of feedback:

Users making modifications to resources need to:
* Every user that was able to authenticate, has privileges to create new feedback.
* Common authenticated users are authorized to modify or delete only the records that they have created.
* Some special users, acting as a moderators, will have privileges to modify or delete only the records that any other user generated.

The API definition must reflect this in the resource paths and their available methods.

The service provider should make every reasonable effort to ensure that feedback records are trustworthy and do not contain false, harmful, or irrelevant information. Active moderators (human or AI) should review the records and remove any that have been proven to be incorrect. Users who repeatedly include incorrect information should have their privileges revoked, their authentication rights deactivated, and, eventually, all their contributed feedback that cannot be proven correct removed.
