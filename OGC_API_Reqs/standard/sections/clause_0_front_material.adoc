The OGC API standards family includes a set of resources that enable anyone to provide or use geospatial information. These APIs primarily describe the publication and access to data (e.g. features, coverages), although they may also reference metadata (i.e. records).

This Standard takes a step further by defining the OGC API - Requirements, which builds upon the concept of OGC API - Records. OGC API - Records is designed to catalogue metadata records. Commonly these records managed by the OGC API records contain metadata associated with resources created by the producer and from the producer's point of view. In contrast, OGC API - Requirements specifies how use the same OGC API Records to provide the users perspective allowing them to describe datasets that a project needs to collect, store, analyze, and present to achieve the project objectives, known as data user requirements. User requirements can be provided on any resource in the same OGC API instance or in other OGC API implementations, whether a geospatial collection or a metadata record in a OGC API Records collection.

Accordingly, this OGC API - Requirements uses the following elements:
* a point of contact collection (that acts as a point of contact catalog)
* a need collection (that acts as a need catalog)
* a requirement collection (that acts as a requirement catalog)

//Thus, a _feedback item_ is the atomic unit of information within a collection, just as a record is in OGC API - Records.  
Thus, each collection corresponds to a catalog, just as a catalog is in OGC API - Records.  

This standard defines
* a common set of query parameters
//* the requirements and characteristics for implementing a user feedback API following OGC API - Feedback.
* the characteristics for implementing a user requirements API following OGC API - Requirements.

The OGC API - Requirements allows not only the HTTP GET method for queries, but also adopts from OGC API - Features - Part 4 the capabilities for creating, modifying and deleting collections using HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.

The following tables lists the endpoints of the OGC API - Requirements that allow any collection to be searched or to be interacted with:

//== Security considerations

See OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, Clause 11.

See OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete, Clause 11.

In addition to the exposed in OGC API - Features - Part 1 and OGC API - Features - Part 4, a common OGC API - Requirements expects the contributions of many different uses, making the management of the privileges different from a common OGC API - Features.

//These are the common rules for the management of feedback:
These are the common rules for the management of users:
* Every user has privileges to create new record.

Users making modifications to resources need to:
//* Every user that was able to authenticate, has privileges to create new feedback.
* Common authenticated users are authorized to modify or delete only the records that they have created.
//* Some special users, acting as a moderators, will have privileges to modify or delete only the records that any other user generated.
* Special users, acting as a administrators, will have privileges to modify or delete the records that any other user generated.

The API definition must reflect this in the resource paths and their available methods.

//The service provider should make every reasonable effort to ensure that feedback records are trustworthy and do not contain false, harmful, or irrelevant information. Active moderators (human or AI) should review the records and remove any that have been proven to be incorrect. Users who repeatedly include incorrect information should have their privileges revoked, their authentication rights deactivated, and, eventually, all their contributed feedback that cannot be proven correct removed.

Active user administrators (human or AI) should review the records and remove any that have been proven to be incorrect or incomplete.
